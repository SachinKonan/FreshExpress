# FreshExpress

This website was built at the Great Arizona Code Challenge from InfusionSoft for a local company called Fresh Express. Fresh Express is a a mobile produce market that provides access to high-quality, affordable produce to residents with little to no access to healthy food. They rennovate old school buses with farm fresh ingredients and sell produce to under-priveliged neighborhoods. 

The company was in need of a website change, so Deverath Iyer and I designed a new website for them. Our website has two key features:

1. Real-Time Tracking

In order to inform the customers of where the bus is during its route and how long it will take to get to its stop, we used a Google Maps JavaScript API and a GPS Insights marker that was on the bus to display where the bus is relative to its stops to the users. In addition, since we used created a Django Project, our administrator end allows the bus driver to add new destinations to bus schedule. 

2. Recipe Search

With the bevy of ingredients on the bus, our website allows the bus driver to add ingredients to the website through the administrator end. We used a recipypuppy API and a search method to find exact recipes based on the number and types of ingredients.
